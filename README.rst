django-markitup-filebrowser
===========================

A Django reusable application for end-to-end markup handling. Includes:

* Easy integration of the `MarkItUp!`_ markup editor widget (by Jay
  Salvat) in Django projects, with server-side support for MarkItUp!'s
  AJAX preview. Plug in MarkItUp! via form widget or template tags.

* ``MarkupField``, a ``TextField`` that automatically renders and
  stores both its raw and rendered values in the database, on the
  assumption that disk space is cheaper than CPU cycles in a web
  application.
